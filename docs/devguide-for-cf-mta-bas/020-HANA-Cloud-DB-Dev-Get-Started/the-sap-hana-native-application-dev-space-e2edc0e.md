# The SAP HANA Native Application Dev Space

Develop, build, and deploy native SAP HANA Cloud multitarget applications or analytical models.

SAP Business Application Studio provides a variety of development spaces \(dev spaces\) that include the tools best suited to help you develop the chosen type of application in the context of a project. A developer can chose which tools are installed in a new development space by selecting the suitable extension packs along with any additional extensions that are needed.

The extension pack for the *SAP HANA Native Application* development space provides a comprehensive set of editors to support the creation of database artifacts \(for example, tables, SQL views, calculation views and analytic privileges, SQLScript procedures, etc.\) as well as the tools needed to enable an end-to-end development flow from project creation to the deployment of the database application to the SAP Business Technology Platform.

The tools and editors are packaged in SAP extensions, which are split into the following groups:

-   [*SAP predefined extensions*](the-sap-hana-native-application-dev-space-e2edc0e.md#loioe2edc0e80c09443fa8db47f235b7d060__section_yjl_q45_nnb)
