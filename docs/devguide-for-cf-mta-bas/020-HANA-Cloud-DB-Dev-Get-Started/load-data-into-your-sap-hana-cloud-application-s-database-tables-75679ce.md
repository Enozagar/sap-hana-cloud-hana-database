## Procedure

1.  Create a new folder for your table-data and CSV files.

    In the `db` module's `src` folder, create a new folder named "`loads`".

2.  Add a file named `BookingDemo.hdbtabledata` to the `src/loads` folder.

    1.  Open the command palette.

        -   Press [Crtl\] + [Shift\] + [P\]  or
        -   Press [F1\] or
        -   Choose *View* \> *Command Palette...*

    2.  Create a new SAP HANA database artifact.

        Type `hana` in the command palette and choose *SAP HANA: Create SAP HANA Database Artifact* in the list of commands displayed.

        The *Create SAP HANA Database Artifact* Wizard is displayed.

    3.  Choose the file location where you want to add the new database artifact.

        Choose *Browse for Folder*, select the project's *src/loads/* folder, and choose *Open*.

    4.  Select the database version.

        Use the drop-down menu provided to choose *SAP HANA Cloud* as the database where you want to create the new database role.

    5.  Select the database artifact type, for example, table.

        In the *Artifact Type* box, type `hdbt`, and choose *Table Data \(hdbtabledata\)* from the list that appears.

    6.  Name the file *BookingDemo*.

        The appropriate file suffix \(`.hdbtabledata`

        > ### Tip:  
        > The file extension is mandatory; it is used to determine which HDI plug-in to call when creating the corresponding run-time object during application build or deployment. SQL DDL table-data-definition artifacts have the file extension \) is appended to the name by the Wizard. `.hdbtabledata`, for example, `MyTableDataDefinition.hdbtabledata`

    7.  Save the changes and create the new database table-data artifact; choose *Create*.


3.  Open the new database table artifact for editing.

    > ### Tip:  
    > SAP Business Application Studio provides a wide variety of dedicated editors that correspond to the database artifact types supported by the SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure \(HDI\). The artifact type, for example, `hdbtable` or `hdbtabledata`, is used by SAP Business Application Studio to determine which editor to open by default to enable editing. Some editors also provide a default template for the artifact type, which you can either adapt, delete, or replace as required.

    Add the following code to the new table data artifact `BookingDemo.hdbtabledata`.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > `BookingDemo.hdbtabledata` 
    > 
    > ```
    > { 
    >   "format_version": 1, 
    >   "imports": [{ 
    >         "target_table": "PASSENGERS", 
    >         "source_data": { 
    >         "data_type": "CSV", 
    >         "file_name": "passengers.csv", 
    >         "has_header": false, 
    >         "dialect": "HANA", 
    >         "type_config": { 
    >           "delimiter": "," 
    >         } 
    >      }, 
    >      "import_settings": { 
    >         "include_filter" : [ ], 
    >         "import_columns": ["PASSENGERID","NAME","ACTIVE","ADDRESS","COUNTRY","PASSPORT","PASSENGERPRIORITYSTATUS"] 
    >      }, 
    >      "column_mappings": { 
    >         "PASSENGERID": 1, 
    >         "NAME": 2, 
    >         "ACTIVE": 3, 
    >         "ADDRESS": 4, 
    >         "COUNTRY": 5, 
    >         "PASSPORT": 6,
    >         "PASSENGERPRIORITYSTATUS":7 
    >      } 
    >   }, 
    >   { 
    >      "target_table": "FLIGHTRESERVATION", 
    >      "source_data": { 
    >         "data_type": "CSV", 
    >         "file_name": "flightreservation.csv", 
    >         "has_header": false, 
    >         "dialect": "HANA", 
    >         "type_config": { 
    >           "delimiter": "," 
    >         } 
    >      }, 
    >      "import_settings": { 
    >         "include_filter" : [ ], 
    >         "import_columns": ["RESERVATIONID","PASSENGERID","MANDT","CARRID","CONNID","FLDATE","SEAT","BOOKINGTIME" ] 
    >      }, 
    >      "column_mappings": { 
    >         "RESERVATIONID": 1, 
    >         "PASSENGERID" : 2, 
    >         "MANDT": 3,      
    >         "CARRID": 4,      
    >         "CONNID": 5, 
    >         "FLDATE": 6,      
    >         "SEAT" : 7 , 
    >         "BOOKINGTIME" : 8 
    >      } 
    >   }] 
    > } 
    > ```

4.  Add a file named `passengers.csv` to the `src/loads` folder.

    In the command palette, choose *SAP HANA: Create SAP HANA Database artifact*, select the project's *src/loads* folder in the database module, choose the database version *SAP HANA Cloud* and the artifact type *csv*, and name the new file `passengers`.

    > ### Tip:  
    > The appropriate file suffix \(`.csv`\) is appended to the file name by the file-creation Wizard. The file extension is mandatory; it is used to determine which HDI plug-in to call when creating the corresponding run-time object during application build or deployment. CSV artifacts have the file extension `.csv`, for example, `MyTableData.csv`

5.  Add the following code to the new table data artifact `passengers.csv`.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > `passengers.csv` 
    > 
    > ```
    > 1,JOEN DIVRO,1,BAR ILAN 8 RAANANA,IL,34567,A

6.  Add a file named `flightreservations.csv` to the `src/loads` folder.

    In the command palette, choose *SAP HANA: Create SAP HANA Database artifact*, select the project's *src/loads* folder in the database module, choose the database version *SAP HANA Cloud* and the artifact type *csv*, and name the new file `flightreservations`.

    > ### Tip:  
    > The appropriate file suffix \(`.csv`\) is appended to the file name by the file-creation Wizard. The file extension is mandatory; it is used to determine which HDI plug-in to call when creating the corresponding run-time object during application build or deployment. CSV artifacts have the file extension `.csv`, for example, `MyTableData.csv`



7.  Add the following code to the new table data artifact `flightreservations.csv`.

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > `flightreservations.csv` 
    >

    > 12,6,400,SQ,0502,20110722,44,20110501
    > ```

8.  Deploy the database module.

    In the *SAP HANA PROJECTS* explorer, locate the project containing the artifacts you want to deploy and choose ![](images/BAS_icon_deploy_4423157.svg) \(*Deploy*\).

    > ### Note:  
    > A mismatch between the installed SAP HANA version and the SAP HANA version specified in the `.hdbconfig` file \(with the optional parameter `"minimmum_feature_version"`\) can cause problems with the deployment operation.

9.  Check that the tables now contain data.

    1.  Display the contents of the HDI container bound to the deployed application.

        In the *SAP HANA PROJECTS* explorer, locate the project containing the artifacts you want to check and choose <span class="SAP-icons-watt">îˆ€</span> \(Open HDI Container\).

        Alternatively, you can choose *SAP HANA: Open Database Explorer* from the command palette \([Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [P\] \).

        The selected HDI container is displayed in the SAP HANA Database Explorer, and you can browse through the different categories of database artifacts, for example, *Column Views*, *Tables*, or *Views*.

    2.  Expand the *FlightReservation...* node in the SAP HANA Database Explorer.

    3.  Choose *Tables*.

    4.  Check the two tables \(`PASSENGERS` and `FLIGHTRESERVATION`\) are listed in the results pane.

    5.  Select each table to display the table's contents in the details pane.

        > ### Note:  
        > In the details pane, choose *Open Data* to display the table's raw data.
