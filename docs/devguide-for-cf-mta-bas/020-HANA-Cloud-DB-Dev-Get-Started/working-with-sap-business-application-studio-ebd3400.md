# Working with SAP Business Application Studio

SAP Business Application Studio provides a modular development environment for the development of business applications for SAP HANA Cloud.

SAP Business Application Studio is a modular-driven environment, tailored for efficient development of business applications for the Intelligent Enterprise. The modularity allows the creation of dev spaces \(K8S pods\), which are tailored for the end-to-end development of SAP-specific business scenarios, for example, front-end development, database development, mobile development, etc.

In SAP Business Application Studio, the developer is provided with one or more development spaces \(also known as Dev Spaces\). A dev space includes the tools, capabilities, and resources that a developer requires to develop an application, for example, not only a Web-based IDE, but also a Git client, a command-line terminal, a file-system for saving source files, build-tools, and run-time environments for debugging and executing the code developed. Each dev space has a unique type determined by the business scenario that the developer wants to develop.

> ### Tip:  
> As a developer, you can chose which tools will be installed in your development space by selecting the extension pack that reflects your business scenario along with any additional extensions that you want or need.

SAP Business Application Studio guides you through the development process required to deploy your business applications; the process includes the following high-level steps:

1.  Set up access to the development tools included in SAP Business Application Studio.

2.  Set up an application project.

3.  Develop your application modules.

    For example, for your data-persistence model, your application business logic, and your client user interface.

4.  Build your application modules.

5.  Deploy the application to Cloud Foundry.
