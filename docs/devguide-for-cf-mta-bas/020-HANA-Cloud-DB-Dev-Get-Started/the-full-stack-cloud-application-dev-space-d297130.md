# The Full-stack Cloud Application Dev Space

Develop, build, and deploy native applications or analytical models using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\).



SAP Business Application Studio provides a variety of development spaces \(dev spaces\) that include the tools best suited to help you develop the chosen type of application project. A developer can chose which tools are installed in a new development space by selecting a suitable extension pack along with any additional extensions that are needed.

The extension pack for the *Full Stack Cloud Application* development space provides a comprehensive set of editors to support the creation of Cloud business-application artifacts as well as the tools needed to enable an end-to-end development flow from project creation to the deployment of the application to the SAP HANA Cloud's Cloud Foundry run-time environment.

The tools and editors are packaged in SAP extensions, which are split into the following groups:

-   [*SAP Predefined extensions*](the-full-stack-cloud-application-dev-space-d297130.md#loiod2971300efb84380a00dc6e41a4b1ff4__section_yjl_q45_nnb)
