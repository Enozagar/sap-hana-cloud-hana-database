# Maintaining JSON Collections in the SAP HANA Document Store

The SAP HANA Document Store \(DocStore\) is used to store collections which contain one or more JSON artifacts \(documents\).

The SAP HANA Document Store is a place where you can collect JSON documents, that is; files with content that is formatted according to the specification defined in the JavaScript Object Notation. The Document Store allows native operations on JSON documents, for example: filtering and aggregation, as well as joins with SAP HANA column- or row-store tables.

You can use standard SQL commands in an SQL console to maintain the document collections in the SAP HANA Document Store and, in addition, the JSON documents that make up the collection, and any values defined in the individual JSON documents.

In this section you can find information about creating and maintaining JSON documents in collections stored in the SAP HANA Document Store, for example:

-   Create a SAP HANA Documentation Store.

-   Add collections to \(and remove them from\) the Document Store.

-   Maintain JSON documents in Document Store collections.
