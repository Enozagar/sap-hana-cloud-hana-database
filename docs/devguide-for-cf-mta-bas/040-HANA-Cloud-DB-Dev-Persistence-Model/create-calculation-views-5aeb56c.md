# Create Calculation Views

Use a graphical editor to create calculation views that depict complex business scenarios.



## Context

Calculation views combine data from various sources. You can combine multiple transaction tables in a calculation view. You can also create calculation views to include layers of calculation logic.



## Procedure

Create a calculation view.

1.  Start SAP Business Application Studio.

2.  To create a new project for the calculation view, do the following:

    1.  Locate and run the command *SAP Business Application Studio: New Project from Template*.

        You can use either of the following methods:

        -   In the *Welcome* tab, choose *Start from Template: Create a new project*.

        -   Press [Crtl\] + [Shift\] + [P\]  \(or just [F1\]\) to display the command palette. In the command palette, type `template`, then choose *SAP Business Application Studio: Create Project from Template* in the list of commands displayed.


    2.  Specify a target folder path.

    3.  Select the template *SAP HANA Database Project*, and choose *Start*.

    4.  Type a name for the new project \(for example, `myApp`\).

    5.  Choose *Next* to retain all the proposed defaults.

    6.  Choose *Finish* to confirm.


3.  Create a new calculation view artifact.



    1.  Open the command palette.

        -   Press [Crtl\] + [Shift\] + [P\]  or
        -   Press [F1\]  or
        -   Choose *View* \> *Command Palette...*

    2.  Locate and run the command *SAP HANA: Create SAP HANA Database Artifact*.

        In the command palette, type `data` and choose *SAP HANA: Create SAP HANA Database Artifact* in the list of commands displayed.

    3.  In the application project's database module, select the folder `src` or a subfolder of `src`.

    4.  Select the database artifact **type**.

        In the selection box, type `hdbc` and choose *hdbcalculationview* in the list that appears.

    5.  Name the new calculation view.

        > ### Note:  
        > For calculation view names, only numbers, letters, underscores \(\_\), and hyphens \(-\) are permitted.

        The file suffix \(`.hdbcalculationview`\) is automatically appended to the name.

        > ### Tip:  
        > The file extension is mandatory. It is used to determine which HDI plug-in to call when creating the corresponding run-time object during application build or deployment. Calculation-view artifacts have the file extension `.hdbcalculationview`, for example, `myCalcView.hdbcalculationview`.


4.  Specify a data category.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Data Category
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Description
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    CUBE
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Specify whether to use a star join.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    DIMENSION
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Specify the dimension type STANDARD or TIME.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
5.  Choose *Create*.

    To open your calculation view in the Calculation View Editor, click the newly created file in the selected folder.

6.  Continue modeling the calculation view by selecting view nodes from the tool palette and adding them to the view editor.

    Connect the nodes to model the data processing at runtime. To switch between any of the inner aggregation or projection nodes, right-click the node and select an option.

7.  Add data sources to a view node. For more information, see *Add Data Sources*.

8.  Define output columns. For more information, see *Define Output Columns*.

9.  Define attributes and measures.

    To successfully activate a calculation view with data category CUBE, you must specify at least one column as a measure.

    1.  Select the *Semantics* node.

    2.  On the *Columns* tab, select a column value.

    3.  In *Type*, select *Measure* or *Attribute*.

        If the data category is set to CUBE, an additional aggregation column is available to specify the aggregation type for measures.


10. **Optional:** View modeler objects in the outline pane.

    Use the outline pane to obtain a quick overview of the modeler objects \(view nodes and columns\) in the calculation view.

    1.  In the editor toolbar, choose <span style="color:#007cc0;"><span class="SAP-icons-V4">î‰§</span></span> \(Outline\).

        The main modeling entities of the calculation view are displayed. Different icons in the outline pane make it easy to distinguish between different join types. You can also select an entity in the outline pane and by this bring the respective entity in the view editor into focus.


11. Buildand deploy an SAP HANA Database Module.

    In the HANA project explorer, select the module and choose *Deploy*.

    The build process uses the design-time database artifacts to generate the corresponding actual objects \(runtime objects\) in the HDI container.
