# SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Developer Guide for Cloud Foundry Multitarget Applications \(SAP Business App Studio\)

Build applications on SAP HANA Cloud and deploy them to Cloud Foundry using SAP Business Application Studio.

The *SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Developer Guide for Cloud Foundry Multitarget Applications \(SAP Business Application Studio\)* describes the steps required to build database applications that access data in SAP HANA Cloud and deploy the applications to the Cloud Foundry run-time environment using the tools provided with the SAP Business Application Studio, for example, the *SAP HANA Native Application* extension, or command-line tools such as the Cloud Foundry's CF CLI. The information in the guide is organized as follows:

-   Introduction and overview

    A high-level overview of the basic capabilities and architecture of SAP HANA Cloud, the Cloud Foundry run-time environment, and multitarget applications.

-   Getting started

    A collection of tutorials which are designed to demonstrate how to build and deploy a simple SAP HANA Cloud application on Cloud Foundry quickly and easily

-   The development process

    Step-by-step information that shows in detail how to develop the various elements that make up a multitarget application. The information provided uses tasks and tutorials to explain how to develop the SAP HANA Cloud development objects. Where appropriate, you can also find background information that explains the context of the task, and reference information that provides the detail you need to adapt the task-based examples to suit the requirements of your application environment.

    > ### Note:  
    > It is also possible to set up a local development environment for SAP HANA database applications in Visual Studio Code, for example, using the *SAP HANA Database Explorer Integration for Visual Studio Code*, which is available for download from the Visual Studio Marketplace. For more information, see *Related Information* below.

-   Reference sources

    A selection of reference guides that support the development process for Cloud Foundry database multitarget applications, for example, a complete list of the HDI plug-ins that you need to ensure that your design-time database artifacts are deployed correctly in the SAP HANA Cloud run-time environment.
