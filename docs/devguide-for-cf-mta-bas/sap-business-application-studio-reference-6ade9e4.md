# SAP Business Application Studio Reference

SAP Business Application Studio is a new development environment \(IDE\) that is provided as a SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\) service in SAP Cloud Foundry.



SAP Business Application Studio provides a desktop-like experience similar to leading IDEs, with command line and optimized editors. At the heart of SAP Business Application Studio are the dev spaces, which are like isolated virtual machines in the Cloud and contain specially tailored tools and pre-installed run times for particular business scenarios, for example: SAP HANA Native Applications, SAP Cloud Business Applications, SAP Fiori, SAP S/4HANA extensions, Workflow, Mobile, and so on. This simplifies and saves time in setting up your development environment and allows you to develop, test, build, and run your solution either locally or in the Cloud.
