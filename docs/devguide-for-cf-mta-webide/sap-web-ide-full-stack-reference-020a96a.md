# SAP Web IDE Full-Stack Reference

SAP Web IDE is a browser-based IDE consisting of integrated parts that interact with each other and with an SAP system.



SAP Web IDE Full-Stack \(SAP Web IDE\) streamlines the end-to-end application lifecycle â€“ easily develop, test, build, deploy, and extend role-based, consumer-grade apps for business users. Create applications rapidly and deliver an outstanding user experience. Developers can extend or build SAP Fiori apps, create new SaaS solutions, extend S/4HANA cloud services, develop hybrid mobile applications and build IoT apps for SAP Leonardo, using the UI development toolkit for HTML5 \(SAPUI5\) for desktop and mobile devices, SAP HANA toolset, and Java programming language and technologies. Since SAP Web IDE Full-Stack runs on SAP Business Technology Platform \(BTP\); it needs no installation and allows you to integrate with other services that run on the platform, for example: SAP Fiori Cloud apps, Git integration, mobile services, IoT services, and more.
