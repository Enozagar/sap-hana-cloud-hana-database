Tutorials that show you how to set up JavaScript applications for Cloud Foundry .

This section includes a selection of tutorials that show you how to set up various basic but important aspects of the application that you plan to deploy on the Cloud Foundry JavaScript run time.

> The tutorials in this section focus on tools provided with the CF command-line client.



## Prerequisites

Before you start the tutorials in this section, bear in mind the following prerequisites:

-   The Cloud Foundry run time must be available and you can log in to it using the CF command-line client. For more information, see *Related Links* below.
-   Node.js is installed locally. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you might need to configure it. For more information about proxy configuration settings for NPM, see *npm Documentation* in the *Related Links* below.
-   SAP Node.js packages

    Configure NPM to resolve SAP-related NPM dependencies using the public NPM Registry \(at `https://registry.npmjs.org`\).
