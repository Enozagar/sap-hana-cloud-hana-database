# Working with the CF Command-Line Client

The CF command-line tools enable access to \(and control of\) the Cloud Foundry run-time environment on SAP Business Technology Platform.

The CF CLI client tools must be downloaded and installed locally, if you want to connect to the Cloud Foundry run time from your local development machine. The package containing the CF CLI client tools can be downloaded from GitHub. For more information, see *Related Information* below.

The CF command-line tools enable you to perform all the steps in the development process which are required to deploy multi-target applications to the Cloud Foundry run-time environment; the process includes the following high-level steps:

1.  Set up an application project environment \(for example: users, organizations and spaces\).

2.  Develop your application modules.

    For example, for the underlying data model, the application business logic, and even the client user interface.

3.  Build and run the individual application modules.

4.  Deploy the complete multi-target application to the Cloud Foundry run-time environment.

    > ### Note:  
    > You will need to install the Cloud Foundry plug-ins for SAP Multitarget Applications \(MTA\). For more information, see *Get Started with the Cloud Foundry Command-line Interface* in *Related Information* below.
