# Setting Up the Analytic Model

Modeling refers to an activity of refining or slicing data in database tables by creating analytic models or views to depict a business scenario.

The modeling process involves the simulation of entities, such as CUSTOMER, PRODUCT, and SALES, and relationships between them. You can use these related entities \(analytic models\) in analytics applications such as SAP BusinessObjects Explorer and Microsoft Office for reporting use cases.

Analytic models or views use various combinations of content data \(that is, non-metadata\) to model a business use case. Content data can be classified as follows:

-   Attribute: Descriptive data, such as customer ID, city, and country.
-   Measure: Quantifiable data, such as revenue, quantity sold and counters.

*SAP Web IDE Full-Stack* provides data modelers and other user personas with the modeling tools to work with SAP HANA design-time content and SAP HANA database catalog objects.
