# Building an Authorization Concept for Users of an Application Instance

Business users in an SAP HANA multitarget application should have different authorizations because they work in different jobs.

For example in the framework of a leave request process, there are employees who want to create and submit leave requests, managers who approve or reject, and payroll administrators who need to see all approved leave requests to calculate the leave reserve.

The authorization concept of a leave request application should cover the needs of these three employee groups. This authorization concept includes elements such as roles, scopes, and attributes.
