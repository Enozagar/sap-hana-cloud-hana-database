# Define the Data an OData Service Exposes

An OData service exposes data stored in database tables or views as OData collections for analysis and display by client applications. However, first of all, you need to ensure that the tables and views to expose as an OData collection actually exist.



## Context

To define the data to expose using an OData service, you must perform the following two steps:



## Procedure

1.  Create a simple database table to expose with an OData service.

2.  Create a simple database view to expose with an OData service. This step is optional; you can expose tables directly. In addition, you can create a calculation view as a modeling view.
