# Defining Web-based Data Access in SAP HANA Cloud

Developers of multitarget applications are provided with access to the SAP HANA Cloud database using a consumption model that is exposed via HTTP.

The consumption model provided by SAP HANA Cloud focuses on multitarget applications making use of a powerful set of specially developed API functions. However, you can use other methods to provide access to the data you want to expose in SAP HANA Cloud. For example, you can set up the Web-based data access for multitarget applications using the following service\(s\):

-   OData

    Create an XSODATA service using OData v2 to expose a data end point in SAP HANA

    > ### Note:  
    > If you want your multitarget application to use OData v4 services, consider using the SAP Cloud Application Programming \(CAP\) model. For more information, see *Related Information* below.
