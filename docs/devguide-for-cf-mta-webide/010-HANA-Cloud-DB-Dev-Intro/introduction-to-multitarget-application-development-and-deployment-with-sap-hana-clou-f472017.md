# Introduction to Multitarget Application Development and Deployment with SAP HANA Cloud

A developerâ€™s view of multitarget applications in the Cloud Foundry run-time platform for SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database.

The *SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database Developer Guide for Cloud Foundry Multitarget Applications* explains how to build, deploy, and maintain native SAP HANA multitarget applications that run in the Cloud Foundry run-time environment. The information provided also describes the technical structure of applications that can be deployed to the Cloud Foundry run-time platform. This guide is aimed at people performing the following developer roles:

-   Database developers

    Often a business or data analyst or a database expert, the database developer is concerned with the definition of the data model and schemas that will be used in SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database; the specification and definition of tables, views, primary keys, indexes, partitions and other aspects of the layout; and the inter-relationship of the data in SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA datatbase.

    The database developer is also concerned with designing and defining authorization and access control, through the specification of privileges, roles, and users and, in addition, authorization scopes.

-   Application programmers

    The programmer is concerned with building Cloud Foundry applications: applications that are one part of so-called multitarget applications \(MTAs\). Programmers develop the code for the business-logic component, for example, in JavaScript \(Node.js and XS JavaScript\), Java, or Python, etc.

-   Client UI developers

    The user-interface \(UI\) client developer designs and creates client applications which bind business logic \(from the application developer\) to controls, events, and views in the client application user interface. In this way, data exposed by the database developer can be viewed in the client application's UI.
