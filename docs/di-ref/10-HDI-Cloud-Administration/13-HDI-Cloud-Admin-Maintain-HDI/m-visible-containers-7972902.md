# M\_VISIBLE\_CONTAINERS

Shows all HDI containers in the database that the user is allowed to see and the container groups to which the visible containers.



The `_SYS_DI` monitoring view `M_VISIBLE_CONTAINERS` shows all HDI containers in the database and the container groups to which they are assigned, that are visible to the user. A container is considered visible, if the user has any privilege on the containerâ€™s API schema or is allowed to access `M_CONTAINERS` in the group, that the container belongs to, or if he is allowed to access `M_ALL_CONTAINERS` in the `_SYS_DI` schema.

> ### Note:  
> The view is public.
