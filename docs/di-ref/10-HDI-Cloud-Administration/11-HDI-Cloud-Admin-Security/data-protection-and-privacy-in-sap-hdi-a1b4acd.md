# Data Protection and Privacy in SAP HDI

An overview of compliance with data protection and privacy regulations in the context of SAP HDI.

The SAP HDI server \(`diserver`\) provides clients with a selection of tools and functions that conform to the legal requirements for the protection and privacy of data included in deployed artifacts, as well as the server infrastructure itself.

The information in this section or any other sections in this guide is not intended as advice on whether the documented features and functions are the best method to support company-, industry-, regional-, or country-specific requirements. Furthermore, this guide does not give any advice or recommendations regarding additional features that might be required in specific IT environments; decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.

> ### Note:  
> In the majority of cases, compliance with data privacy laws is not a product feature. SAP software supports data privacy by providing security features and specific functions relevant to data protection, such as functions for the simplified blocking and deletion of personal data. SAP does not provide legal advice in any form. The definitions and other terms used in this guide are not taken from any given legal source.
