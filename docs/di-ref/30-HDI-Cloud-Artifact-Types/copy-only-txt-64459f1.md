# Copy Only \(.txt\)

Transform an arbitrary design-time resource into a deployed object.



The copy-only plug-in transforms an arbitrary design-time resource \(defined in a `.txt` artifact\) into a deployed object by copying it from the containerâ€™s work file system to the deployed file system.

> ### Restriction:  
> This type of design-time resource does not have a representation inside the run-time container. The resource is only accessible by means of SAP HANA DI APIs.
