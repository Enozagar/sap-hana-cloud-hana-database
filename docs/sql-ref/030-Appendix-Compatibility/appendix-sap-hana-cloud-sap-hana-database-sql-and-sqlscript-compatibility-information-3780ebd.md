## About This Documentation

This section provides information about SQL features that are in other SAP HANA versions but that are not available in SAP HANA Cloud, and is intended for customers who are migrating an SAP HANA Platform database to SAP HANA Cloud.

In many cases, the features listed in this section are not available because they are not relevant in a cloud context. In other cases, the features may become available in subsequent releases of SAP HANA Cloud, and possibly in a different forms, at which point these topics will be updated accordingly.
