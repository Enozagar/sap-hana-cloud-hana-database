# Monitoring Views

SAP HANA includes a set of runtime views called monitoring views that provide actual SAP HANA runtime data, including statistics and status information related to the execution of DML statements. These views are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting performance. The data in monitoring views is not stored on disk; it is calculated when you execute a query on one of the views.

All monitoring views in SAP HANA start with M\_.
