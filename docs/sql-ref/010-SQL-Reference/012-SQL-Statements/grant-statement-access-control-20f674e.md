## Syntax Elements


<dl>
<dt><b>

*<grantee\>*

</b></dt>
<dd>

Specifies the user or role that the privilege is being granted to. A role is a named collection of privileges and can be granted to either a user or another role.

```
<grantee> :: = { <user_name>   | <role_name> }
```

```
<user_name> ::= <unicode_name>
```

```
<role_name> ::= [<schema_name>.]<identifier>

<schema_name> ::= <unicode_name>
```

If a privilege or role is granted to a role, then all users granted that role have the specified privilege or role.

If you want to allow several database users to perform the same actions, then create a role, grant the required privileges to this role, and finally grant the role to the different database users.

When granting roles to roles, a tree of roles can be built. When granting a role \(R\) to a role or user \(G\), user G has all the privileges directly granted to role R and all privileges granted to roles that have been granted to role R.

*<user\_name\>* specifies the grantee's user name.

*<role\_name\>* specifies the grantee's role name with optional schema name.

*<schema\_name\>* specifies the schema containing the database object to be acted upon.

A reference to a schema-local role \(that is, a role for which a schema\_name was specified at creation time\), must always be preceded by its *<schema\_name\>* wherever it is referenced \(for example, <code>GRANT <b><i class="varname">&lt;schema_name&gt;</i></b>.<i class="varname">&lt;role_name&gt;</i> TO...)</code>.



</dd><dt><b>

*<role\_name\>*

</b></dt>
<dd>

Grants a specified role to a *<grantee\>*. To grant a role, you must have been granted the role with WITH GRANT OPTION. If the role has been granted to a role group, you must also have the OPERATOR object privilege on the role group.



</dd><dt><b>

*<role\_in\_a\_rolegroup\>*...USING GROUP

</b></dt>
<dd>

Grants a specified role within a role group to a *<grantee\>*. USING GROUP allows the role group to be the grantor instead of the executing user. This prevents the loss of the grant chain in the event the granting user is dropped. The GRANTOR object privilege on the role group is required to perform this grant statement.



</dd><dt><b>

*<system\_privilege\>*

</b></dt>
<dd>

Grants the specified system privilege.

Authorizes the INSERT statement for the object.

The INSERT and UPDATE privilege are both required on the object to allow the REPLACE and UPSERT statements to be used.

While INSERT applies to views, it only applies to updatable views \(views that do not use a join, do not contain a UNION, and do not use aggregation\).

</td>
<td valign="top">

Authorizes a user to:

-   Change the settings for a role group.
-   Add and remove roles to/from a role group.
-   Use the COMMENT ON statement for a role group.

Users with the OPERATOR privilege can also create and drop roles, but only within the role group they have the OPERATOR privilege on \(CREATE ROLE *<user\_name\>* SET ROLEGROUP *<rolegroup\_name\>*\).

A user can have the OPERATOR privilege on more than one role group, and a role group can have more than one user with the OPERATOR privilege on it.

When moving roles between groups, users must have the OPERATOR object privilege on both the current role group of the role and the new role group the role is being moved to.

When granting OPERATOR on a role group, you must include the keyword ROLEGROUP before the name of the role group \(for example: GRANT OPERATOR ON **ROLEGROUP** *<rolegroup\_name\>* TO *<grantee\>*\) This is slightly different syntax than granting other object privileges.

## Description

The GRANT statement grants privileges to users and roles. It also grants roles to users and other roles.

The default schema for a user always has the same schema name as the user.



<a name="loio20f674e1751910148a8b990d33efbdc5__section_o5s_n4x_4bb"/>

## Permissions

To use the GRANT statement to grant privileges to other users and roles, a user must have the privilege and also the permissions required to grant that privilege.

**DBADMIN \(cloud super-user\), non-RESTRICTED users, and RESTRICTED users**: A DBADMIN user has all system privileges and the role PUBLIC. However, a DBADMIN user cannot select or change data in another user's tables unless this privilege has been explicitly granted. A non-RESTRICTED user has the PUBLIC role, has the privileges required to create objects in their own default schema, and can grant privileges on their objects to other users and roles. A RESTRICTED user does not have the PUBLIC role and cannot create objects in their own schemas. RESTRICTED users have only the privileges that have been explicitly granted to them.

Users can not grant privileges to themselves.

For objects that are dependent on other objects, like views being dependent on tables, there may be times when the owner of the dependent object does not have a complete set of privileges. This situation can occur if the user does not have privileges on the underlying objects on which their object depends.



<a name="loio20f674e1751910148a8b990d33efbdc5__sql_grant_1sql_grant_examples"/>

## Examples

Create a schema called `my_schema`.

```
CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;
```

Create a table named `work_done` in the `my_schema` schema.

```
CREATE ROW TABLE my_schoolwork_done (t TIMESTAMP, user NVARCHAR (256), work_done NVARCHAR (256));
```

Create a new user named worker with password `His_Password_1`.

```
CREATE USER worker PASSWORD His_Password_1;
```

Create a role called `role_for_work_on_my_schema`.

```
CREATE ROLE role_for_work_on_my_schema;
```

Grant the SELECT privilege on any object in `my_schema` to the `role_for_work_on_my_schema`.

```
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA my_schema TO role_for_work_on_my_schema;
```

Grant the INSERT privilege for the `my_schoolwork_done` table to the `role_for_work_on_my_schema`.

```
GRANT INSERT ON my_schoolwork_done TO role_for_work_on_my_schema;
```

Grant the `role_for_work_on_my_schema` role to the worker user.

```
GRANT role_for_work_on_my_schema TO worker WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```

Grant the DELETE privilege for the `my_schoolwork_done table` to the `worker` user.

```
GRANT DELETE ON my_schoolwork_done TO worker;
```

Grant the `worker` user the privilege to create any kind of object in the schema named `my_schema`.

```
GRANT CREATE ANY ON SCHEMA my_schema TO worker;
```

The result of the above statements is that the worker user has the privilege to SELECT all tables and views in schema my\_schema, to INSERT into and DELETE from table `my_schoolwork_done`, and to create objects in schema `my_schema`. Additionally the worker user can grant DELETE on the table `myschema.work_done` to other users and roles.

Grant the INIFILE ADMIN and TRACE ADMIN privileges to the user `worker`. You grant these privileges along with the permission for the worker user to grant them further.

```
GRANT INIFILE ADMIN, TRACE ADMIN TO worker WITH ADMIN OPTION;
```

Grant the LINKED DATABASE privilege to user `myuser1` to execute linked database queries by using the remote source `myremotesys`.

```
GRANT LINKED DATABASE ON REMOTE SOURCE myremotesys TO myuser1;
```
